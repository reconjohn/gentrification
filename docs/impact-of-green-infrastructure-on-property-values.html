<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Impact of green infrastructure on property values</h1>
<p>Many studies have mostly found green infrastructure has positive impacts on property values: (1) transferring water resource to public ownership will increase a property’s sale price by 0.0353% for a wetland and 0.1177% for a stream (Netusil, N. R., 2013); (2) properties on tree-lined streets are valued at up to 30% more than those on streets without trees (Global Designing Cities Initiative); (3) realtor based estimates of street tree versus non street tree comparable streets relate a $15-25,000 increase in home or business value (Burden, D, 2006); (4) 25% of survey participants see increasing property values; (5) marginal benefits to one household of preserving neighboring open space range from $994 to $3,307 per acre of farmland that is preserved, depending on whether it is publicly or privately owned (Irwin, E. G., 2002); (6) the effect of neighborhood association-owned forest and water feature was approximately 8% at the mean sale price with a value of $14488 for association-owned forests, and $14681 for a water feature (Bowman et al., 2012); and (7) increase in home price is approximately $18 for every acre of public park within walking distance (Bowman et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Specially bioswales are also known to improve local property values (Anderson, J., 2018); the neighborhoods will see an increase in property values and habitability due both the functional and aesthetic value of the bioswales (O’Neill, P., 2013).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Netusil et al. (2014) found there is a negative impact on a property’s sale price as distance from the nearest green infrastructure increases while bioswales are not significant.</p>
<div id="positive" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Positive</h2>
<p>Using the spatial lag model coefficients, we estimate that transferring 1000 square feet of a privately owned water resource to public ownership will increase a property’s sale price by 0.0353% for a wetland and 0.1177% for a stream. These values can be used to calculate a lower-bound benefit estimate for an acquisition by creating a ¼ mile buffer around single-family residential properties and determining, for a specific site, how many of those buffers overlap the water resource (Netusil, N. R., 2013).</p>
<p>Street trees and green infrastructure enhance aesthetic qualities and provide a significant neighborhood amenity. Properties on tree-lined streets are valued at up to 30% more than those on streets without trees (Global Designing Cities Initiative, <a href="https://globaldesigningcities.org/publication/global-street-design-guide/utilities-and-infrastructure/green-infrastructure-stormwater-management/benefits-green-infrastructure/" class="uri">https://globaldesigningcities.org/publication/global-street-design-guide/utilities-and-infrastructure/green-infrastructure-stormwater-management/benefits-green-infrastructure/</a>).</p>
<p>Added value to adjacent homes, businesses and tax base. Realtor based estimates of street tree versus non street tree comparable streets relate a $15-25,000 increase in home or business value. This often adds to the base tax base and operations budgets of a city allowing for added street maintenance. Future economic analysis may determine that this is a break-even for city maintenance budgets (Burden, D, 2006).</p>
<p>Below is how people see the impact of green infrastructure on property value increase for investment.

<p>Tyra¨vinen and Miettinen (2000) conduct a careful study of the spillover effects of the various attributes associated with urban forests on housing prices in a semi-rural area in Finland. They find that the distance to the nearest small area of forest has a negative and significant effect, and that the presence of a forest view from the housing unit has a positive influence…Given the conditions within the Maryland study area, which are characterized by relatively high rates of population growth and land conversion, we find that the marginal benefits to one household of preserving neighboring open space range from $994 to $3,307 per acre of farmland that is preserved, depending on whether it is publicly or privately owned (Irwin, E. G., 2002).</p>
<p>Consequently the neighborhoods in which they are built will see an increase in property values and habitability due both the functional and aesthetic value of the bioswales (O’Neill, P. (2013).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional benefits of bioswales include growth of vegetation, which has been shown to improve asphalt longevity (McPherson, 2005), mitigate the urban heat island effect, and improve local property values (Bowman, 2010).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public parks and nearby open space have been shown to positively influence housing prices by both proximity and amount of use (Bolitzer and Netusil, 2000, Bowman et al., 2009; Kitchen and Hendon, 1967; Lutzenhiser and Netusil, 2001)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The effects of neighborhood association-owned forest and water features were positive and significant. The marginal effect of these features was approximately 8% at the mean sale price with a value of $14488 for association-owned forests, and $14681 for a water feature. These findings are similar to other studies (e.g., Lorenzo et al., 2000, Ready and Abdalla, 2005) with the presence of private forests associated with higher home prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, for publically-held open space size did matter -open space within walking distance (500 m) of a house had a marginal effect (at p &lt; 0.057) of 0.02% per acre, which at the mean price of a home in Ames is an increase in home price of approximately $18 for every acre of public park within walking distance. As Peiser and Schwann (1993) found, this effect is miniscule when compared with the marginal effect of a similar amount of additional lot space ($24659 at the mean sale price)…previous hedonic price model studies identify the value of public open space and the significant positive effect they have on home prices within a community (Bolitzer and Netusil, 2000, Correll et al., 1978).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, a spatial hedonic price model using 2093 homes in Ames, IA was used to estimate the effect of public and private open space on housing values. The model indicated that presence of neighborhood association-owned forest and water features as well as proximity to public parks had significant positive effects on housing prices. However, proximity to a public lake had a negative effect on home values.</p>

<p>Portland, Oregon has a long history of developing low-impact development facilities through its ‘green streets’ program and continues to promote these facilities as improving air and water quality, enhancing pedestrian and bicycle access and safety, expanding the amount of urban green space and wildlife habitat, and increasing property values (Environmental Services City of Portland, 2008). Findings from the present study provide support for some of these claims but challenge others. For example, we find a small but statistically significant increase in a property’s sale price as distance from the nearest facility increases. Facility type (sidewalk bioswale, corner curb extension, curb extension, or grassy bioswale) is not found to have a statistically significant effect on a property’s sale price, but a facility’s size, age, design complexity, tree canopy coverage, and abundance of facilities at the census tract or census block level do have a statistically significant effect (Netusil et al., 2014).</p>
